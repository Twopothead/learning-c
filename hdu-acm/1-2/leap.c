/**
 * Problem 1.2.5: The Next N-th Leap Year (An Easy Task)
 *
 *   Ignatius was born in a leap year,
 *   so he want to know when he could hold his birthday party.
 *   Can you tell him?
 *   Given a positive integers Y which indicate the start year,
 *   and a positive integer N, your task is to tell the Nth leap year from year Y.
 *   Note: if year Y is a leap year, then the 1st leap year is year Y.
 *
 * Input:
 *   The input contains several test cases.
 *   The first line of the input is a single integer T which is the number of test cases.
 *   T test cases follow.
 *   Each test case contains two positive integers Y and N(1<=N<=10000).
 *
 * Sample Input:
 *   3
 *   2005 25
 *   1855 12
 *   2004 10000
 *
 * Output:
 *   For each test case, you should output the Nth leap year from year Y.
 *
 * Sample Output:
 *   2108
 *   1904
 *   43236
 *
