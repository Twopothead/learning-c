/**
 * Problem 1.2.3: Climbing Worm
 *  An inch worm is at the bottom of a well n inches deep.
 *  It has enough energy to climb u inches every minute,
 *  but then has to rest a minute before climbing again.
 *  During the rest, it slips down d inches.
 *  The process of climbing and resting then repeats.
 *  How long before the worm climbs out of the well?
 *  We'll always count a portion of a minute as a whole minute
 *  and if the worm just reaches the top of the well at the end of its climbing,
 *  we'll assume the worm makes it out.
 *
 * Input:
 *   There will be multiple problem instances.
 *   Each line will contain 3 positive integers n, u and d.
 *   These give the values mentioned in the paragraph above.
 *   Furthermore, you may assume d < u and n < 100.
 *   A value of n = 0 indicates end of output.
 *
 * Sample Input:
 *   10 2 1
 *   20 3 1
 *   0 0 0
 *
 * Output:
 *   Each input instance should generate a single integer on a line,
 *   indicating the number of minutes it takes for the worm to climb out of the well.
 *
 * Sample Output:
 *   17
 *   19
